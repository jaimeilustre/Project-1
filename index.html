        <h1>Imagine this:</h1>
            <p> You just finished 3rd on the race, you got your trophy and celebrated the win.
            After the celebration, you find out that you have been disqualified since a piece of wood underneath your
            car
            is in breach of regulations. You're absolutely frustrated and you decide to show this by retaliating. How?
            By taking that piece of wood and throwing it against the governing body.
            </p>
        <h1>Instructions </h1>
            <p>Drive your Formula 1 car and throw that piece of wood to every FIA car you see!!!</p>
